# map-project
An interactive map shows, in which fields some specific documents can be found.

The map displays a first layer of interactivity by coloring fields (=countries in this version) on mouseover.
PROTOTYPE --- http://www.lernenzwei.ch/karten_projekt/

File names of relevant documents (=comparative studies in this version) are read into the script. Computation starts based on these names (parts of the file names).
The relevant fields/countries are found immediately. One can assign a "chosen colour" to the fields/countries.
