# map-project
An interactive map shows specific documents based on rules.

The map displays a first layer of interactivity by coloring fields (=countries in this version) on mouseover.

PROTOTYPE --- http://www.lernenzwei.ch/karten_projekt/

The script reads file names of relevant documents (=comparative studies in this version) from a directory. 
Computation starts based on these names (parts of the file names).
